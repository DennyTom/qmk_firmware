# Georgi QWERTY/Steno firmware

This is my Colemak keymap for Georgi, it's based somewhat on the default and Colemak-DH Georgi keymaps, the Butterstick default keymap, and my own Ergodox layout.

You probably don't want to use this, it's very customized to my own uses and in many cases is repurposing things from my other keyboards that don't even apply to my Georgi use case just to have some consistency between them. But maybe there could be some ideas you'd like to use.

## Space issues
If you find yourself running out of space for dictionary entries, disabling mousekeys in rules.mk will save
you about 4k for entries!
